# Sentiment-analysis-using-grover-s
This is a very useless project 
#Overview

This project implements a Quantum-Enhanced Sentiment Analysis Model, leveraging Grover's Algorithm for Quantum Feature Selection and a Random Forest Classifier for sentiment classification. The model integrates classical TF-IDF and Word2Vec feature extraction with quantum feature selection to enhance text classification.

#Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text data.

Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings.

Quantum Feature Selection: Implements Groverâ€™s algorithm to identify optimal features.

Machine Learning Classification: Uses Random Forest Classifier for sentiment analysis.

Model Evaluation: Computes accuracy and generates a classification report.
